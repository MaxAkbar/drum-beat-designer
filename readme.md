# drum-beat-designer

Drum Beat Designer is a very simple drum machine for Windows. It started as a fun project to help me learn both WPF and .NET audio processing.

## Installation

DrumBeatDesigner can be built by running build_dist.bat found in the root. Output will be found in the dist directory.

## Usage

Run DrumBeatDesigner.exe.
